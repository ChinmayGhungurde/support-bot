64e683ff-4383-41fb-94c3-d91d6605274d,This app just makes itself worse with every update. Now you can't even manual control the resolution of your video. It's automatic. Before you could choose what setting you wanted nope not anymore. Why? No idea. They feel stripping us of control in the app is a good thing that will bring more users. Edit. YEAH MAKE NETFLIX AS WORSE AS EVERYTHING IN INDIA! GREAT PLAN!! Christ. You guys just WANT to lose money.,1

(Working with VLC would be nice but I'm not going to hold my breath) My only other complaint is I wish there were more TV shows pacifically from the 90s and early 2000s and so on.

You are stealing money from people by not providing the services we are paying you for. You are forcing people to sacrifice a service they are paying you extra for. It's bad business and a scam. Your service is not worth the same as before yet you seem to think it is. You are making it harder for us to enjoy the service we pay you for. You should make it cheaper because you took away half of the services,2

Those who are not using the main connection or internet with the main account would be asked to update netflix household on their tv everytime they will watch.

If your paying for Netflix you should be able to have a certain number of people on. Just because your not making as much money doesn't mean you have to bully your customers into purchasing Netflix. Raise you monthly to 15 like hbo did and let people use their membership however and with whoever they want. Netflix has become greedy without having the movies and shows to back it.,2

84a1e358-9ed9-438a-9a8e-93086d9a2701,I've had Netflix for a minimum of 10 years until the last few years. New shows take years to get the new seasons by then you totally forgot everything about the show. You would figure with the huge price increase Netflix would be better at getting their shows out quickly to keep their customers interested in Netflix. Don't get me wrong they have good shows that they're producing but when it takes two to three years for a new season I personally lose interest.,3

02274b6c-b7e3-4220-8cd8-d6d4e32744c3,This is because to the Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard Documentary released by Netflix which is absolutely ridiculous. Pushing false narratives and agendas to restore Amber Heard's reputation. How does she always get away with everything she has done till date. Netflix releasing this documentary proves that she has a much bigger support system behind her. I expected much better from a platform like Netflix. The main media trashed Johnny for 6 years and now when the truth is out still truth is twisted,1

All movies are only updated in india and actually NO movies or literally no updation or movie releases in Dubai. It is better to cancel the plan as it is such a waste of money. Nothing to watch. But when you go to any other region you have plenty of options to watch. I would receommend Dubai people not to waste ur money buy downloading Netflix or any related apps.
