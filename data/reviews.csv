64e683ff-4383-41fb-94c3-d91d6605274d,This app just makes itself worse with every update. Now you can't even manual control the resolution of your video. It's automatic. Before you could choose what setting you wanted nope not anymore. Why? No idea. They feel stripping us of control in the app is a good thing that will bring more users. Edit. YEAH MAKE NETFLIX AS WORSE AS EVERYTHING IN INDIA! GREAT PLAN!! Christ. You guys just WANT to lose money.,1

2d18a468-05d4-439b-bc06-bed46825397d,Hi all. Love Netflix as they have a better updated selection and a bettervariety/selection of movies on their apps. Runs smoothly with Wifi no buffering. Have enjoyed it more than other apps available. Rated 5 star as you have a investment opportunity with Netflix and other top brands. Easy to use. Add information and payment methods.,5

They try and force you to watch their movies And shows by taking the more popular Anime And got rid of english dub Hoping we would tolerate their versions. I stopped watching their shows when they went to A.I script writers. It's horrible story lines that focuses on colors sounds To stimulate chemical reaction in the brain. Essentially treating their audience like toddlers. Their practice is highly insulting..,1

Then they want to increase the cost . Same experience with Hulu and like You Tube it freezes constantly. Seems like these streaming apps like cable TV are getting worse.,2

74dd5cd5-349e-4bff-99ac-abd0651716ab,I love your streaming service but I hate your rising prices and taking away CDs and Blu-ray. You are stealing money from people by not providing the services we are paying you for. You are forcing people to sacrifice a service they are paying you extra for. It's bad business and a scam. Your service is not worth the same as before yet you seem to think it is. You are making it harder for us to enjoy the service we pay you for. You should make it cheaper because you took away half of the services,2

Any time I choose a movie or show to watch using Netflix it starts for literally a half a second and then freezes. I try and press fast forward to jog it through to the next screen but that doesn't even help. I've waisted money three different months in hopes that things will change but it never does. 😔,1

Most of The Movies that I'm Trying to obtain is movies that you have already shown. So Their shouldn't be a problem getting them. Allow this to Happen and I will give up The 5 🤩 stars and 2 👍👍. Keep up the amazing work. Thank You So Much ur 1 & Only PROUD MARY RAW😎🌟✌️ PEACE,4

Those who are not using the main connection or internet with the main account would be asked to update netflix household on their tv everytime they will watch. It's too troublesome and the only solution is to add a member slot which means additional expenses. What's the point of availing the premium plan for my family if i have to spend more than I should have. Make it make sense.,2

If you think of a film and go and search for it, chances are it won't be available which is what frustrates me the most about it. The selection is pathetic considering the size of the company. They also do very irritating things like recently put up Men in black and Men in Black 3, but didn't put Men in black 2. Most the content is just pish.

On one hand, it offers a wide selection of shows and movies to suit everyone's tastes, allowing users to binge-watch their favorite shows or discover new content. But on the other hand, its abundance of content can cause choice paralysis, making it difficult for some users to decide what to watch. In addition, Netflix's recommendation algorithm isn't perfect, which can make it hard to find content that you'll actually enjoy.",5

For one app price of premium I could have 4+ apps at the same price per year with multiple different choices. Netflix has just become a money grab at this stage. They hook you in with a great series and then cancel the series in second season... And now with the multiple houses restricted access you've just lost I would say 50% of your subscriptions.

Are you still watching this. No I just like to let it run for the dog. I am trying to watch it. Now I can't. Why do I say that. Just hold on are you still reading this. Prove it.

If your paying for Netflix you should be able to have a certain number of people on. Just because your not making as much money doesn't mean you have to bully your customers into purchasing Netflix. Raise you monthly to 15 like hbo did and let people use their membership however and with whoever they want. Netflix has become greedy without having the movies and shows to back it.,2

New shows take years to get the new seasons by then you totally forgot everything about the show. You would figure with the huge price increase Netflix would be better at getting their shows out quickly to keep their customers interested in Netflix. Don't get me wrong they have good shows that they're producing but when it takes two to three years for a new season I personally lose interest.,3

Netflix releasing this documentary proves that she has a much bigger support system behind her. I expected much better from a platform like Netflix.
